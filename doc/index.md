---

Welcome to the **RingLike** library documentation!

This library provides a flexible and modular framework to work with
algebraic structures such as semirings, rings, and fields, as well as
their generalizations on various types like integers, polynomials,
matrices, and more.

## Quick start

- To learn about the basic concepts and usage, see the [Core module
  documentation](RingLike.Core.html).
- To explore examples and advanced features, browse the other
  generated HTML files.

## About RingLike

RingLike represents algebraic structures with optional operations such
as opposite (negation), subtraction, inverse, and division, enabling
smooth handling of semirings, rings, and fields in a unified way.

Whether you work with natural numbers, integers, rationals, or more
complex structures, RingLike provides a clean interface and solid
foundation.

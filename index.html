<h1 id="ringlike-a-library-for-ring-like-algebraic-structures">RingLike:
A Library for Ring-Like Algebraic Structures</h1>
<p>Welcome to the <strong>RingLike</strong> library documentation!</p>
<p>This library provides a flexible and modular framework to work with
algebraic structures such as semirings, rings, and fields (corps), as
well as their generalizations on various types like integers,
polynomials, matrices, and more.</p>
<h2 id="quick-start">Quick start</h2>

<h2 id="about-ringlike">About RingLike</h2>
<p>RingLike represents algebraic structures with optional operations
such as opposite (negation), subtraction, inverse, and division,
enabling smooth handling of semirings, rings, and fields in a unified
way.</p>
<p>Whether you work with natural numbers, integers, rationals, or more
complex structures, RingLike provides a clean interface and solid
foundation.</p>
